# React Jobly

This is a project for Springboard's Software Engineering Career Track.

Here is the project description from Springboard:

> -   You’ll create and deploy a React front-end for the Jobly app you made in Section III
>
> In this unit, you’ll create a dynamic front-end React app using everything that you’ve learned in Section IV. This application will have a well designed component hierarchy, a functional database, an API helper, routing, a jobs page, authentication, a user profile, in progress applications, and more. When you’re done designing your app, you’ll deploy it using Heroku so anyone can access the app. Don’t worry, this application does not need to be connected to a real job board and does not need to host real job data.

The front-end was created with create-react-app and the backend uses Express.
